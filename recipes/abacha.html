        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This is the first part of making Abacha (African Salad), stir very well to get the yellowish paste. Then add the ground crayfish and pepper, stir, then add the ground ehu if you like.

            Ugba is an important ingredient in making African salad, I consider it incomplete without the presence of this ingredient. Ugba is usually sold in most Nigerian markets or African shops (if you live outside Nigeria).</p>
        <p>Add the ugba to the mixture and stir, and then add the abacha, salt. It is advisable to heat the abacha (using the method outlined above) just a few seconds before you use so it doesn’t get cold.

            Most people in Nigeria like their Abacha to be a little warm</p>

                <li>Blend your crayfish and also slice the onions, garden egg leaves. It is advisable to dissolve the powdered potash in about half a cup of clean water; this is a trick I employ just filter out unwanted solid materials that are often embedded in potash.</li>
